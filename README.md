This project is made on google colab, and can also be viewed on vs code and Jupyter notebook. 
It uses the algorithm K-means clustering.
K-means clustering is a type of Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm.
Using k-means it classifies customers visting a mall into clusters. 
Out of all the data of the customers it uses their annual income and their spending score to analyse which cluster of customers generate more profit for the mall giving them the leverage to utilise this info for their benefit by introducing new policies or discounts.
For this project the required libraries are pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, and KMeans.
